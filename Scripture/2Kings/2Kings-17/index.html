Therefore Yahweh sent lions among them, which killed some of them.</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v26</h6></a><p>Therefore they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, &ldquo;The nations which you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria don&rsquo;t know the law of the god of the land.
