He said, &ldquo;Behold, I dreamed a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v14><h6 id=v14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v14</h6></a><p>His fellow answered, &ldquo;This is nothing other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel.
