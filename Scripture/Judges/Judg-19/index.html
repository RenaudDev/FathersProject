There is no lack of anything.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v20><h6 id=v20><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v20</h6></a><p>The old man said, &ldquo;Peace be to you! Just let me supply all your needs, but don&rsquo;t sleep in the street.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v21><h6 id=v21><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v21</h6></a><p>So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</p><a href=#v22><h6 id=v22><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v22</h6></a><p>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, &ldquo;Bring out the man who came into your house, that we can have sex with him!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v23><h6 id=v23><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v23</h6></a><p>The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, &ldquo;No, my brothers, please don&rsquo;t act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, don&rsquo;t do this folly.</p><a href=#v24><h6 id=v24><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v24</h6></a><p>Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine.

When the day began to dawn, they let her go.</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v26</h6></a><p>Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man&rsquo;s house where her lord was, until it was light.</p><a href=#v27><h6 id=v27><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v27</h6></a><p>Her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v28</h6></a><p>He said to her, &ldquo;Get up, and let&rsquo;s get going!&rdquo; but no one answered.
