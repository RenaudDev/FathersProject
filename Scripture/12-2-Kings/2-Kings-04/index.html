Don&rsquo;t slow down for me, unless I ask you to.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v25><h6 id=v25><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v25</h6></a><p>So she went, and came to the man of God to Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her afar off, he said to Gehazi his servant, &ldquo;Behold, there is the Shunammite.</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v26</h6></a><p>Please run now to meet her, and ask her, &lsquo;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with your child?&rsquo;&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v27><h6 id=v27><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v27</h6></a><p>When she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, &ldquo;Leave her alone; for her soul is troubled within her; and Yahweh has hidden it from me, and has not told me.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v28</h6></a><p>Then she said, &ldquo;Did I ask you for a son, my lord? Didn&rsquo;t I say, &lsquo;Do not deceive me&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v29><h6 id=v29><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v29</h6></a><p>Then he said to Gehazi, &ldquo;Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand, and go your way. If you meet any man, don&rsquo;t greet him; and if anyone greets you, don&rsquo;t answer him again. Then lay my staff on the child&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v30><h6 id=v30><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v30</h6></a><p>The child&rsquo;s mother said, &ldquo;As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So he arose, and followed her.</p><a href=#v31><h6 id=v31><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v31</h6></a><p>Gehazi went ahead of them, and laid the staff on the child&rsquo;s face; but there was no voice and no hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, &ldquo;The child has not awakened.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v32><h6 id=v32><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v32</h6></a><p>When Elisha had come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and lying on his bed.</p><a href=#v33><h6 id=v33><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v33</h6></a><p>He went in therefore, and shut the door on them both, and prayed to Yahweh.</p><a href=#v34><h6 id=v34><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v34</h6></a><p>He went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands. He stretched himself on him; and the child&rsquo;s flesh grew warm.</p><a href=#v35><h6 id=v35><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v35</h6></a><p>Then he returned, and walked in the house once back and forth; and went up, and stretched himself out on him. Then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</p><a href=#v36><h6 id=v36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v36</h6></a><p>He called Gehazi, and said, &ldquo;Call this Shunammite!&rdquo; So he called her. When she had come in to him, he said, &ldquo;Take up your son.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v37><h6 id=v37><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v37</h6></a><p>Then she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; then she picked up her son, and went out.</p><a href=#v38><h6 id=v38><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v38</h6></a><p>Elisha came again to Gilgal. There was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his servant, &ldquo;Get the large pot, and boil stew for the sons of the prophets.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v39><h6 id=v39><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v39</h6></a><p>One went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds from it, and came and cut them up into the pot of stew; for they didn&rsquo;t recognize them.</p><a href=#v40><h6 id=v40><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v40</h6></a><p>So they poured out for the men to eat. As they were eating some of the stew, they cried out, and said, &ldquo;Man of God, there is death in the pot!&rdquo; And they could not eat it.</p><a href=#v41><h6 id=v41><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v41</h6></a><p>But he said, &ldquo;Then bring meal.&rdquo; He threw it into the pot; and he said, &ldquo;Serve it to the people, that they may eat.&rdquo; And there was nothing harmful in the pot.</p><a href=#v42><h6 id=v42><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v42</h6></a><p>A man from Baal Shalishah came, and brought the man of God some bread of the first fruits: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his sack.
