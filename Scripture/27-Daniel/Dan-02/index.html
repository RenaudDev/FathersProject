So they came in and stood before the king.</p><a href=#v3><h6 id=v3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v3</h6></a><p>The king said to them, &ldquo;I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v4><h6 id=v4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v4</h6></a><p>Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in the Syrian language, &ldquo;O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v5><h6 id=v5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v5</h6></a><p>The king answered the Chaldeans, &ldquo;The thing has gone from me. If you don&rsquo;t make known to me the dream and its interpretation, you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill.</p><a href=#v6><h6 id=v6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v6</h6></a><p>But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you will receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor. Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v7><h6 id=v7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v7</h6></a><p>They answered the second time and said, &ldquo;Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v8><h6 id=v8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v8</h6></a><p>The king answered, &ldquo;I know of a certainty that you are trying to gain time, because you see the thing has gone from me.</p><a href=#v9><h6 id=v9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v9</h6></a><p>But if you don&rsquo;t make known to me the dream, there is but one law for you; for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the situation changes. Therefore tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me its interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v10><h6 id=v10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v10</h6></a><p>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, &ldquo;There is not a man on the earth who can show the king&rsquo;s matter, because no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or Chaldean.</p><a href=#v11><h6 id=v11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v11</h6></a><p>It is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is no other who can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v12><h6 id=v12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v12</h6></a><p>Because of this, the king was angry and very furious, and commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.</p><a href=#v13><h6 id=v13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v13</h6></a><p>So the decree went out, and the wise men were to be slain. They sought Daniel and his companions to be slain.</p><a href=#v14><h6 id=v14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v14</h6></a><p>Then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king&rsquo;s guard, who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.</p><a href=#v15><h6 id=v15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v15</h6></a><p>He answered Arioch the king&rsquo;s captain, &ldquo;Why is the decree so urgent from the king?&rdquo; Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p><a href=#v16><h6 id=v16><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v16</h6></a><p>Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time, and he would show the king the interpretation.</p><a href=#v17><h6 id=v17><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v17</h6></a><p>Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p><a href=#v18><h6 id=v18><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v18</h6></a><p>that they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p><a href=#v19><h6 id=v19><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v19</h6></a><p>Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p><a href=#v20><h6 id=v20><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v20</h6></a><p>Daniel answered, &ldquo;Blessed be the name of God forever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.</p><a href=#v21><h6 id=v21><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v21</h6></a><p>He changes the times and the seasons.

He went and said this to him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t destroy the wise men of Babylon. Bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v25><h6 id=v25><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v25</h6></a><p>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said this to him: &ldquo;I have found a man of the children of the captivity of Judah who will make known to the king the interpretation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v26</h6></a><p>The king answered Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, &ldquo;Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v27><h6 id=v27><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v27</h6></a><p>Daniel answered before the king, and said, &ldquo;The secret which the king has demanded can&rsquo;t be shown to the king by wise men, enchanters, magicians, or soothsayers;</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v28</h6></a><p>but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these:</p><a href=#v29><h6 id=v29><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v29</h6></a><p>&ldquo;As for you, O king, your thoughts came on your bed, what should happen hereafter; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what will happen.</p><a href=#v30><h6 id=v30><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v30</h6></a><p>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.</p><a href=#v31><h6 id=v31><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v31</h6></a><p>&ldquo;You, O king, saw, and behold, a great image. This image, which was mighty, and whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and its appearance was terrifying.</p><a href=#v32><h6 id=v32><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v32</h6></a><p>As for this image, its head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of bronze,</p><a href=#v33><h6 id=v33><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v33</h6></a><p>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron, and part of clay.</p><a href=#v34><h6 id=v34><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v34</h6></a><p>You saw until a stone was cut out without hands, which struck the image on its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</p><a href=#v35><h6 id=v35><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v35</h6></a><p>Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, so that no place was found for them. The stone that struck the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</p><a href=#v36><h6 id=v36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v36</h6></a><p>&ldquo;This is the dream; and we will tell its interpretation before the king.</p><a href=#v37><h6 id=v37><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v37</h6></a><p>You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory.</p><a href=#v38><h6 id=v38><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v38</h6></a><p>Wherever the children of men dwell, he has given the animals of the field and the birds of the sky into your hand, and has made you rule over them all.
