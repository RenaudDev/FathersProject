Behold, three more kings will stand up in Persia; and the fourth will be far richer than all of them. When he has grown strong through his riches, he will stir up all against the realm of Greece.</p><a href=#v3><h6 id=v3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v3</h6></a><p>A mighty king will stand up, who will rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p><a href=#v4><h6 id=v4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v4</h6></a><p>When he stands up, his kingdom will be broken, and will be divided toward the four winds of the sky, but not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion with which he ruled; for his kingdom will be plucked up, even for others besides these.</p><a href=#v5><h6 id=v5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v5</h6></a><p>&ldquo;The king of the south will be strong. One of his princes will become stronger than him, and have dominion. His dominion will be a great dominion.</p><a href=#v6><h6 id=v6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v6</h6></a><p>At the end of years they will join themselves together; and the daughter of the king of the south will come to the king of the north to make an agreement; but she will not retain the strength of her arm. He will also not stand, nor will his arm; but she will be given up, with those who brought her, and he who became the father of her, and he who strengthened her in those times.</p><a href=#v7><h6 id=v7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v7</h6></a><p>&ldquo;But out of a shoot from her roots one will stand up in his place, who will come to the army, and will enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and will deal against them, and will prevail.</p><a href=#v8><h6 id=v8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v8</h6></a><p>He will also carry their gods, with their molten images, and with their goodly vessels of silver and of gold, captive into Egypt. He will refrain some years from the king of the north.</p><a href=#v9><h6 id=v9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v9</h6></a><p>He will come into the realm of the king of the south, but he will return into his own land.</p><a href=#v10><h6 id=v10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v10</h6></a><p>His sons will wage war, and will assemble a multitude of great forces, which will come on, and overflow, and pass through. They will return and wage war, even to his fortress.</p><a href=#v11><h6 id=v11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v11</h6></a><p>&ldquo;The king of the south will be moved with anger, and will come out and fight with him, even with the king of the north.

Yes, also the prince of the covenant.</p><a href=#v23><h6 id=v23><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v23</h6></a><p>After the treaty made with him he will work deceitfully; for he will come up, and will become strong, with a small people.</p><a href=#v24><h6 id=v24><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v24</h6></a><p>In time of security he will come even on the fattest places of the province. He will do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers&rsquo; fathers. He will scatter among them prey, plunder, and substance. Yes, he will devise his plans against the strongholds, even for a time.</p><a href=#v25><h6 id=v25><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v25</h6></a><p>&ldquo;He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south will wage war in battle with an exceedingly great and mighty army; but he won&rsquo;t stand; for they will devise plans against him.</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v26</h6></a><p>Yes, those who eat of his dainties will destroy him, and his army will be swept away. Many will fall down slain.</p><a href=#v27><h6 id=v27><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v27</h6></a><p>As for both these kings, their hearts will be to do mischief, and they will speak lies at one table; but it won&rsquo;t prosper, for the end will still be at the appointed time.</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v28</h6></a><p>Then he will return into his land with great wealth.

Therefore he will be grieved, and will return, and have indignation against the holy covenant, and will take action. He will even return, and have regard to those who forsake the holy covenant.</p><a href=#v31><h6 id=v31><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v31</h6></a><p>&ldquo;Forces will stand on his part, and they will profane the sanctuary, even the fortress, and will take away the continual burnt offering.
