But let&rsquo;s fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be stronger than they.</p><a href=#v24><h6 id=v24><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v24</h6></a><p>Do this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their place.</p><a href=#v25><h6 id=v25><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v25</h6></a><p>Muster an army, like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot.

The children of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of young goats; but the Syrians filled the country.</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v28</h6></a><p>A man of God came near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Yahweh says, &lsquo;Because the Syrians have said, &ldquo;Yahweh is a god of the hills, but he is not a god of the valleys;&rdquo; therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am Yahweh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><a href=#v29><h6 id=v29><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v29</h6></a><p>They encamped opposite each other for seven days. So it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in one day.</p><a href=#v30><h6 id=v30><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v30</h6></a><p>But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were left. Ben Hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner room.</p><a href=#v31><h6 id=v31><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v31</h6></a><p>His servants said to him, &ldquo;See now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings.

Maybe he will save your life.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v32><h6 id=v32><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v32</h6></a><p>So they put sackcloth on their bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, &ldquo;Your servant Ben Hadad says, &lsquo;Please let me live.&rsquo;&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;Is he still alive? He is my brother.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v33><h6 id=v33><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v33</h6></a><p>Now the men observed diligently, and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, &ldquo;Your brother Ben Hadad.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Go, bring him.&rdquo; Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.</p><a href=#v34><h6 id=v34><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v34</h6></a><p>Ben Hadad said to him, &ldquo;The cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rdquo;, said Ahab, &ldquo;will let you go with this covenant.&rdquo; So he made a covenant with him, and let him go.</p><a href=#v35><h6 id=v35><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v35</h6></a><p>A certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by Yahweh&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;Please strike me!&rdquo; The man refused to strike him.</p><a href=#v36><h6 id=v36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v36</h6></a><p>Then he said to him, &ldquo;Because you have not obeyed Yahweh&rsquo;s voice, behold, as soon as you have departed from me, a lion will kill you.&rdquo; As soon as he had departed from him, a lion found him and killed him.</p><a href=#v37><h6 id=v37><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v37</h6></a><p>Then he found another man, and said, &ldquo;Please strike me.&rdquo; The man struck him and wounded him.</p><a href=#v38><h6 id=v38><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v38</h6></a><p>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.</p><a href=#v39><h6 id=v39><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v39</h6></a><p>As the king passed by, he cried to the king; and he said, &ldquo;Your servant went out into the middle of the battle; and behold, a man came over, and brought a man to me, and said, &lsquo;Guard this man!
