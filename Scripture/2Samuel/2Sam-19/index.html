Therefore do what is good in your eyes.</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v28</h6></a><p>For all my father&rsquo;s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v29><h6 id=v29><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v29</h6></a><p>The king said to him, &ldquo;Why do you speak any more of your matters?

Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear the voice of singing men and singing women any more? Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king?</p><a href=#v36><h6 id=v36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>v36</h6></a><p>Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king.
