When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &ldquo;Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v7><h6 id=v7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v7</h6></a><p>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &ldquo;Go now to your brother Amnon&rsquo;s house, and prepare food for him.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v8><h6 id=v8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v8</h6></a><p>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&rsquo;s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</p><a href=#v9><h6 id=v9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v9</h6></a><p>She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, &ldquo;Have all men leave me.&rdquo; Then every man went out from him.</p><a href=#v10><h6 id=v10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v10</h6></a><p>Amnon said to Tamar, &ldquo;Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.&rdquo; Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.</p><a href=#v11><h6 id=v11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v11</h6></a><p>When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, &ldquo;Come, lie with me, my sister!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v12><h6 id=v12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v12</h6></a><p>She answered him, &ldquo;No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don&rsquo;t you do this folly.</p><a href=#v13><h6 id=v13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v13</h6></a><p>As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v14><h6 id=v14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v14</h6></a><p>However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</p><a href=#v15><h6 id=v15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v15</h6></a><p>Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, &ldquo;Arise, be gone!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v16><h6 id=v16><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v16</h6></a><p>She said to him, &ldquo;Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!&rdquo; But he would not listen to her.</p><a href=#v17><h6 id=v17><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v17</h6></a><p>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, &ldquo;Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v18><h6 id=v18><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v18</h6></a><p>She had a garment of various colors on her; for the king&rsquo;s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.</p><a href=#v19><h6 id=v19><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v19</h6></a><p>Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</p><a href=#v20><h6 id=v20><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v20</h6></a><p>Absalom her brother said to her, &ldquo;Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don&rsquo;t take this thing to heart.&rdquo; So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom&rsquo;s house.</p><a href=#v21><h6 id=v21><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v21</h6></a><p>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</p><a href=#v22><h6 id=v22><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v22</h6></a><p>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p><a href=#v23><h6 id=v23><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v23</h6></a><p>After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king&rsquo;s sons.</p><a href=#v24><h6 id=v24><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v24</h6></a><p>Absalom came to the king, and said, &ldquo;See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v25><h6 id=v25><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v25</h6></a><p>The king said to Absalom, &ldquo;No, my son, let&rsquo;s not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&rdquo; He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.</p><a href=#v26><h6 id=v26><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v26</h6></a><p>Then Absalom said, &ldquo;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&rdquo; The king said to him, &ldquo;Why should he go with you?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v27><h6 id=v27><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v27</h6></a><p>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king&rsquo;s sons go with him.</p><a href=#v28><h6 id=v28><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v28</h6></a><p>Absalom commanded his servants, saying, &ldquo;Mark now, when Amnon&rsquo;s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, &lsquo;Strike Amnon,&rsquo; then kill him. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Haven&rsquo;t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v29><h6 id=v29><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v29</h6></a><p>The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&rsquo;s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.</p><a href=#v30><h6 id=v30><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v30</h6></a><p>While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, &ldquo;Absalom has slain all the king&rsquo;s sons, and there is not one of them left!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v31><h6 id=v31><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v31</h6></a><p>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</p><a href=#v32><h6 id=v32><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v32</h6></a><p>Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&rsquo;s brother, answered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king&rsquo;s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</p><a href=#v33><h6 id=v33><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v33</h6></a><p>Now therefore don&rsquo;t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king&rsquo;s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v34><h6 id=v34><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v34</h6></a><p>But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.</p><a href=#v35><h6 id=v35><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v35</h6></a><p>Jonadab said to the king, &ldquo;Behold, the king&rsquo;s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v36><h6 id=v36><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v36</h6></a><p>As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king&rsquo;s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.</p><a href=#v37><h6 id=v37><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v37</h6></a><p>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.</p><a href=#v38><h6 id=v38><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v38</h6></a><p>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</p><a href=#v39><h6 id=v39><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v39</h6></a><p>King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.</p><hr><p><a href=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Sam-12 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Sam-12>← 2 Samuel 12</a> | <a href=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Samuel rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Samuel>2Samuel</a> | <a href=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Sam-14 rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Scripture/2Samuel/2Sam-14>2 Samuel 14 →</a></p></article><hr><div id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3 class=hidden>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container class=hidden></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://www.christianwritings.org/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Renaud Gagne using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.christianwritings.org/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
