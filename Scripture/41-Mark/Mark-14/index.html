He was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.</p><a href=#v55><h6 id=v55><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v55</h6></a><p>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.</p><a href=#v56><h6 id=v56><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v56</h6></a><p>For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony didn&rsquo;t agree with each other.</p><a href=#v57><h6 id=v57><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v57</h6></a><p>Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,</p><a href=#v58><h6 id=v58><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v58</h6></a><p>&ldquo;We heard him say, &lsquo;I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><a href=#v59><h6 id=v59><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v59</h6></a><p>Even so, their testimony didn&rsquo;t agree.</p><a href=#v60><h6 id=v60><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v60</h6></a><p>The high priest stood up in the middle, and asked Jesus, &ldquo;Have you no answer? What is it which these testify against you?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v61><h6 id=v61><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v61</h6></a><p>But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, &ldquo;Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?&rdquo;</p><a href=#v62><h6 id=v62><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v62</h6></a><p>Jesus said, &ldquo;I am.

What do you think?&rdquo; They all condemned him to be worthy of death.</p><a href=#v65><h6 id=v65><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v65</h6></a><p>Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, &ldquo;Prophesy!&rdquo; The officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</p><a href=#v66><h6 id=v66><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v66</h6></a><p>As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of the high priest came,</p><a href=#v67><h6 id=v67><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v67</h6></a><p>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, &ldquo;You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v68><h6 id=v68><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v68</h6></a><p>But he denied it, saying, &ldquo;I neither know, nor understand what you are saying.&rdquo; He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.</p><a href=#v69><h6 id=v69><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v69</h6></a><p>The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by, &ldquo;This is one of them.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v70><h6 id=v70><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v70</h6></a><p>But he again denied it. After a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, &ldquo;You truly are one of them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.&rdquo;</p><a href=#v71><h6 id=v71><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v71</h6></a><p>But he began to curse, and to swear, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know this man of whom you speak!&rdquo;</p><a href=#v72><h6 id=v72><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor></span>v72</h6></a><p>The rooster crowed the second time.
