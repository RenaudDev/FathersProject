# Who is St. Ignatius of Antioch?
**Ignatius of Antioch** also known as Ignatius Theophorus meaning "the God-bearing"), was an early Christian writer and Patriarch of Antioch. While en route to Rome, where he met his martyrdom, Ignatius wrote a series of letters. This correspondence now forms a central part of a later collection of works known to be authored by the Apostolic Fathers. He is considered to be one of the three most important of these, together with Clement of Rome and [[church fathers/Polycarp Of Smyrna/index.md|Polycarp Of Smyrna]]. His letters also serve as an example of early Christian theology. Important topics they address include ecclesiology, the sacraments, and the role of bishops.
