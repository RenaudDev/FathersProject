# Who Was St. Polycarp of Smyrna?
**Polycarp** AD 69 – 155 was a Christian bishop of Smyrna. According to the Martyrdom of Polycarp, he died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body. Polycarp of Smyrna is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican, and Lutheran churches.

Both Irenaeus and Tertullian say that Polycarp had been a disciple of John the Apostle, one of Jesus' disciples. In On Illustrious Men, Jerome writes that Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle and that John had ordained him as a bishop of Smyrna. Polycarp is regarded as one of three chief [Apostolic Fathers](../apostolic-fathers), along with Clement of Rome and [Ignatius Of Antioch](apostolic%20fathers/Ignatius%20Of%20Antioch).
